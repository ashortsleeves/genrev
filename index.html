	<p class = "abouttext">"Gen Rev" stands for General Revelation, which is a theological term.  It refers to the way God reveals Himself to us through nature and all of the things the human mind might discover just by living life on earth.  (Special Revelation, on the other hand, refers to God's direct Word to us, as in the Bible).</p>
